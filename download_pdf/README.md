# Download PDF section

This part is purposed to scrape all pdf links stored in each website, download these files, and stored them into different folders. 

Here are some noteworthy tips that users should consider while they are implementing the code: 
1. Your static IP address might be forbidded if you download too many files in using this code. Thus, dynamic IP is more preferable and safe for long-term downloading. 
2. ScienceDirect only provides subscription-based access to all pdfs. If the user does not have the membership, implementing this code would only download a small fraction of free files, which, in some ways, prove my codes are completely legal.
