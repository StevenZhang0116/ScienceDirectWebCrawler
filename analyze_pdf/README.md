# Analyze PDF contents

In the analyze_text.py file, I use pdfminer package to convert PDF contents by page into the JSON file, also handle the exceptional errors from Unicode transformations. 

In pdfminer_tester.py file, I propose a general outline of the idea to automatically identify and extract figures/tables/entities from the paper by analyzing the formats of the documents (e.g, text arrangments and vertical/horizontal lines). I use different color frames to highlight their locations and pull out the content. However, the accuracy is relevant to low, so the code is still a semi-manufacture. (Noteworthy, the Semantic Scholar website accomplishes that goal successfully and elegantly using computer vision. )
